    "Covariance is a statistical measure that indicates the degree to which two variables change together. In other words, it measures the extent to which changes in one variable are associated with changes in another variable. Covariance can be positive, indicating that the two variables tend to increase or decrease together, or negative, indicating that one variable tends to increase while the other decreases.\n",
