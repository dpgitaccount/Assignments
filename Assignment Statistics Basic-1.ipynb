    "The mean provides the average value and is sensitive to outliers. It is suitable for datasets with a symmetric distribution.\n",

    "Measures of Variability:--\n",

    "1.Range:- The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.\n",
    "It provides a simple measure of spread but is highly influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "It is the easiest measure to calculate but may not accurately represent the variability if outliers are present.\n",

    "2.Variance:- The variance measures the average squared deviation from the mean.\n",
    "It quantifies the spread of the dataset by taking into account the differences of each value from the mean.\n",
    "The variance is commonly used in statistical calculations and further serves as the basis for other measures of variability.\n",
