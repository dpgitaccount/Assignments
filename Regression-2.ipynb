    "\n",
    "R-squared (R²) is a statistical measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a linear regression model. It provides valuable insights into how well the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model explain the variability observed in the dependent variable. In simple terms, R-squared quantifies the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) included in the model.\n",

    "Interpretation of R-squared:--\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared values range from 0 to 1.\n",
    "A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.\n",
    "An R-squared value of 0 means that the independent variable(s) in the model do not explain any of the variance in the dependent variable, and the model provides no predictive power.\n",
    "An R-squared value of 1 means that the independent variable(s) perfectly explain all the variance in the dependent variable, and the model fits the data perfectly.\n",
    "In practice, R-squared values typically fall between 0 and 1, and a good model is one that has an R-squared value that is reasonably close to 1.\n",
    "Interpretation of R-squared in context:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential to interpret R-squared in the context of the specific problem and dataset.\n",
    "A high R-squared value does not necessarily imply causation or that the model is the best possible fit for the data. It may be overfitting or including irrelevant variables.\n",
    "Conversely, a low R-squared value does not mean that the model is entirely useless; it might still provide some valuable insights or capture part of the relationship between variables.\n",
    "R-squared should be used in conjunction with other model evaluation metrics and domain knowledge to make informed decisions about the model's usefulness and relevance."

    "While R-squared measures the goodness of fit by assessing how well the independent variables explain the variance in the dependent variable, adjusted R-squared takes into account the number of predictors (independent variables) in the model. It is designed to provide a more balanced and realistic evaluation of model fit, particularly when dealing with models that include multiple predictors.\n",

    "Penalizing Complexity:-\n",
    "The key difference between R-squared and adjusted R-squared lies in the penalty applied for adding more independent variables to the model. Adjusted R-squared penalizes the inclusion of additional predictors, whereas R-squared does not. This penalty accounts for the fact that adding more predictors can artificially inflate the regular R-squared value, making it appear that the model fits the data better than it actually does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation:-\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular R-squared can increase (or remain unchanged) as you add more predictors to the model, even if those predictors do not significantly improve the model's explanatory power. This can lead to overfitting, where the model is too complex and may not generalize well to new data.\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, will decrease or remain stable as you add more predictors that do not substantially improve the model's fit. This makes it a more conservative measure of model fit.\n",
    "In general, a higher adjusted R-squared indicates a better balance between model complexity and explanatory power. It encourages modelers to consider the trade-off between adding more predictors and the actual improvement in model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Selection:-\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared is often used in model selection and comparison. When comparing different models with varying numbers of predictors, you can use adjusted R-squared to assess which model provides the best balance between fit and simplicity. Models with higher adjusted R-squared values, while controlling for the number of predictors, are generally preferred."

    "Model Building and Feature Selection:-\n",
    "When building a predictive model or selecting features for a machine learning model, adjusted R-squared can guide the process. It encourages you to include only those predictors that add meaningful explanatory power to the model, improving its overall effectiveness.\n",

    "Advantages of MAE:-\n",

    "\n",
    "Regularized linear models are a set of techniques used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a regularization term to the linear regression cost function. Overfitting occurs when a model learns to fit the training data too closely, capturing noise and random fluctuations, which can lead to poor generalization to new, unseen data. Regularization helps mitigate overfitting by imposing constraints on the model's complexity and the magnitude of its coefficients. Here's how it works, illustrated with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are building a linear regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and neighborhood. You have a dataset of historical house sales with these features and their corresponding sale prices.\n",

    "1. Ordinary Linear Regression (No Regularization):\n",
    "\n",
    "In ordinary linear regression, you minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS) to fit the model to the training data. The cost function is typically:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost = RSS = Σ(yi - ŷi)²\n",

    "This can lead to overfitting, where the model's performance on the training data is excellent, but its performance on new, unseen data is poor because it has essentially memorized the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ridge Regularization:\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent overfitting, you can apply Ridge regularization, which adds a penalty term to the cost function based on the sum of squared coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cost = RSS + λ * Σ(βi²)\n",
    "\n",
    "The regularization parameter λ controls the strength of the penalty. A higher λ value results in greater regularization, meaning the model's coefficients are shrunk more towards zero.\n",

In some cases, engineering new features or using non-linear transformations of existing features can significantly improve model performance. Linear models may not capture these relationships effectively.\n",

    "Multicollinearity:-\n",
    "While Ridge regularization can handle multicollinearity (high correlation among independent variables) better than standard linear regression, it may still not completely resolve the issue.

In such cases, more advanced techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or feature engineering may be needed.\n",

    "Regularized linear models tend to provide less interpretable coefficient estimates, especially when features are penalized to zero (as in Lasso). If you require a highly interpretable model, linear regression without regularization or decision tree-based models might be preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning:-\n",
    "Regularized linear models have hyperparameters, such as the regularization strength (λ), that need to be tuned. Finding the right hyperparameter values can be challenging and computationally expensive. Other models, like decision trees, are less sensitive to hyperparameter choices.\n",

    "Sample Size:-\n",
