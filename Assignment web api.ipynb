    "# Application Programming Interface (API) is a software interface that allows two applications to interact with each other without any user intervention. API is a collection of software functions and procedures. In simple terms, API means a software code that can be accessed or executed. API is defined as a code that helps two different software’s to communicate and exchange data with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Features of API-\n",
    "# 1.It offers a valuable service (data, function, audience,.).\n",
    "# 2.It helps you to plan a business model.\n",
    "# 3.Simple, flexible, quickly adopted.\n",
    "# 4.Managed and measured.\n",
    "# 5.Offers great developer support.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Types of API- \n",
    "# 1. Open APIs: These types of APIs are publicly available to use like OAuth APIs from Google. It has also not given any restriction to use them. So, they are also known as Public APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Partner APIs: Specific rights or licenses to access this type of API because they are not available to the public.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Internal APIs: Internal or private. These APIs are developed by companies to use in their internal systems. It helps you to enhance the productivity of your teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Composite APIs: This type of API combines different data and service APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example - Goggle map, Watsapp, facebook, amzon, flipcart, ola, uber, paytm, goggle pay and many more.\n"

    "# Web API is an API as the name suggests, it can be accessed over the web using the HTTP protocol. It is a framework that helps you to create and develop HTTP based RESTFUL services. The web API can be developed by using different technologies such as java, ASP.NET, etc. Web API is used in either a web server or a web browser. Basically Web API is a web development concept. It is limited to Web Application’s client-side and also it does not include a web server or web browser details. If an application is to be used on a distributed system and to provide services on different devices like laptops, mobiles, etc then web API services are used. Web API is the enhanced form of the web application.\n",
    "# 1.Web APIs are very useful in implementation of RESTFUL web services using .NET framework.\n",
    "# 2.Web API helps in enabling the development of HTTP services to reach out to client entities like browser, devices or tablets.\n",

    "# REST was designed specifically for working with components such as media components, files, or even objects on a particular hardware device. Any web service that is defined on the principles of REST can be called a RestFul web service. A Restful service would use the normal HTTP verbs of GET, POST, PUT and DELETE for working with the required components. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.\n",

    "# It is based on XML which is used in the form of masseging protocol.\n",
    "# It is used web service description language internally.\n",
