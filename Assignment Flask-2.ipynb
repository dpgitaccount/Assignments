    "The GET method is used to submit the HTML form data. This data is collected by the predefined $_GET variable for processing.\n",
    "The information sent from an HTML form using the GET method is visible to everyone in the browser's address bar, which means that all the variable names and their values will be displayed in the URL. Therefore, the get method is not secured to send sensitive information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of GET method (method = \"get\"):-\n",
    "\n",
    "1.You can bookmark the page with the specific query string because the data sent by the GET method is displayed in URL.\n",
    "2.GET requests can be cached.\n",
    "3.GET requests are always remained in the browser history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of GET Method:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1.The GET method should not be used while sending any sensitive information.\n",
    "2.A limited amount of data can be sent using method = \"get\". This limit should not exceed 2048 characters.\n",
    "3.For security reasons, never use the GET method to send highly sensitive information like username and password, because it shows them in the URL.\n",
    "4.The GET method cannot be used to send binary data (such as images or word documents) to the server.\n",
