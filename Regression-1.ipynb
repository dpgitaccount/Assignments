    "Simple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Simple linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a single independent variable (predictor variable) and a dependent variable (target variable). \n",
    "It assumes that this relationship is linear, meaning that a change in the independent variable is associated with a constant change in the dependent variable. \n",
    "The equation for simple linear regression is typically represented as:\n",
    "    \n",
    "y=b0+b1∗x+e\n",

    "\n",
    "Linear regression makes several assumptions about the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. \n",
    "These assumptions are important because violations can lead to biased or unreliable results. Here are the key assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity:-\n",
    "The relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable should be linear. \n",
    "This means that a change in the independent variable(s) should result in a constant change in the dependent variable. \n",
    "You can check this assumption by creating scatterplots to visualize the relationship or by examining residual plots to see if they exhibit a random pattern around zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Errors:-\n",
    "The errors (residuals) should be independent of each other. \n",
    "In other words, the value of the error for one data point should not depend on the values of errors for other data points. You can check this assumption by examining a plot of residuals against the order in which they were collected or by using time-series analysis techniques if your data has a time component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance of Errors):-\n",
    "The variance of the errors should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. \n",
    "This means that the spread of the residuals should remain roughly the same throughout the range of the independent variable(s). You can check this assumption by plotting residuals against the predicted values and looking for a consistent spread or by using statistical tests like the Breusch-Pagan or White test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of Errors:-\n",
    "The errors should be normally distributed. \n",
    "This means that the distribution of residuals should follow a bell-shaped curve. You can check this assumption by creating a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals and looking for deviations from a normal distribution. Additionally, you can use statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or the Anderson-Darling test to assess normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "No or Little Multicollinearity:-\n",
    "In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other (multicollinearity). High multicollinearity can make it difficult to interpret the individual effects of predictors. You can check for multicollinearity by calculating correlation coefficients between the independent variables or by using variance inflation factor (VIF) values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset, you can perform the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Inspection:-\n",
    "Create scatterplots of the dependent variable against each independent variable to check for linearity. Plot residuals against predicted values to assess homoscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual Analysis:-\n",
    "Examine residual plots for patterns that might violate the assumptions (e.g., heteroscedasticity). Use statistical tests like the Breusch-Pagan, White, Shapiro-Wilk, or Anderson-Darling tests to check for normality and heteroscedasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Analysis:-\n",
    "Calculate correlation coefficients between independent variables to detect multicollinearity. Calculate VIF values to quantify the extent of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformations:-\n",

    "Concept of Gradient Descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective Function: In machine learning, we often have a cost function or loss function (often denoted as ()\n",

    "\n",
    "Parameter Update:\n",
    "Gradient descent iteratively updates the model parameters (e.g., weights and biases) by subtracting a fraction of the gradient from the current parameter values. The fraction is known as the learning rate (\n",
    "α), which determines the step size in each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative Process: The algorithm repeats this process for a predefined number of iterations or until the cost function converges to a minimum. In each iteration, it computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the model parameters and updates the parameters accordingly.\n",

    "\n",
    "Model Training:\n",
    "During the training phase, machine learning models adjust their parameters to minimize the cost function. Gradient descent is used to find the optimal set of parameters by iteratively updating them based on the gradient of the cost function.\n",

In other words, it occurs when there is a strong linear relationship between two or more independent variables. Multicollinearity can lead to several problems in regression analysis and should be addressed. \n",

    "High Correlation: Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a multiple linear regression model have a high correlation, meaning that they move together in a predictable way.
